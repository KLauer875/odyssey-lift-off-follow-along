# Odyssey Lift-off follow-along

My personal fork of the Odyssey Lift-Off Apollo-GraphQL tutorial series. I'm only updating this description for some rudimentary pratice interfacing with GitHub and to note how far along I am.

- ~~Lift-off I: Basics~~
- ~~Lift-off II: Resolvers~~
- ~~Lift-off III: Arguments~~
- ~~Lift-off Lab~~
- Lift-off IV: Mutations
- Lift-off V: Production & the Schema Registry
- Lift-off: Destination
- Side Quest: Authentication & Authorization
- Side Quest: Intermediate Schema Design

Here's [a preview of the completed demo app](https://lift-off-client-demo.netlify.app/) to reference the intended end-result.

Everything below this is copied from the main fork.

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step by step on how to implement the features you see in the demo app. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
